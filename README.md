# README

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing real transactional data for a Brazilian e-commerce company from 2016 to 2018. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsforecast and sklearn), Jupyter notebooks, forecasting, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/sales-forecasting/)).
